 * to check the prefetch time, you will flush the cache before or after
 * the benchmark but not during (unless you want to measure the time of
 * prefetching and then cleaning)
 * 
 * If the benchmark function requires an argument, you can give it via
 * the void* second argument
 *

 * it is recommended to not print anything after running the init
 * function... If you really want to print something and use the results
 * in Python, you can print your text beginning with # and do not forget

 * specify if you want the time in microseconds (Âµs) or nanoseconds 
 * (ns). If use_nano is 1, then time will be given in ns.
